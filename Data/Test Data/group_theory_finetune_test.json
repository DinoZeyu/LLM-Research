At each cell, four actions are possible: north, south, east, and west, which deterministically cause the agent to move one cell in the respective direction on the grid. Actions that would take the agent off the grid leave its location unchanged, but also result in a reward of $-1$. Other actions result in a reward of $0$, except those move the agent out of the special states A and B. From state A, all four actions yield a reward of +10 and take the agent to A'. From state B, all actions yield a reward of +5 and take the agent to B'. Suppose the discount gamma=0.9. The state-value function of a policy $\\pi$ is defined as the expected cumulative reward of $\\pi$ given the current state.
