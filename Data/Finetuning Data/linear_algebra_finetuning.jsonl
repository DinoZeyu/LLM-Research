{"prompt": "How to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem?", "completion": "The Cayley-Hamilton theorem can be proven using induction. First, let's consider the case where A is a 1x1 matrix. In this case, A can be written as (a) for some scalar a. Then, the characteristic polynomial of A is given by p(t) = a-t. We have p(A) = aI - A = aA - A = (a-1)A. Therefore, p(A) = 0, which proves the theorem for the 1x1 case. Now, let's consider the case where A is a 2x2 matrix. We can write A as \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} for some scalars a, b, c, and d. Then, the characteristic polynomial of A is given by p(t) = (a-t)(d-t) - bc = ad - t^2 - bc = -t^2 + (a+d)t - (ad + bc). We have p(A) = \\begin{bmatrix} -t^2 + (a+d)t - (ad + bc) & -bt \\\\ -ct & -t^2 + (a+d)t - (ad + bc) \\end{bmatrix}. Evaluating this at t = a, we get p(A) = \\begin{bmatrix} -a^2 + (a+d)a - (ad + bc) & -ba \\\\ -ca & -a^2 + (a+d)a - (ad + bc) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -ba \\\\ -ca & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = -A^2. Therefore, p(A) = 0, which proves the theorem for the 2x2 case. Now, let's consider the case where A is a larger matrix. Let A be an nxn matrix, and let A_i denote the ith column of A. We can write A as \\begin{bmatrix} A_1 & A_2 & \\dots & A_n \\end{bmatrix}. Then, the characteristic polynomial of A is given by p(t) = det(tI - A). We have p(A) = det(AI - A) = det(0) = 0. Therefore, p(A) = 0, which proves the theorem for the case where A is an nxn matrix. \n"}
