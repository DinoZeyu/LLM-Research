Then, we have c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 +... + c_k v_k = 0, where v_i are the eigenvectors and c_i are the coefficients. Multiplying both sides by the matrix A, we get A (c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 +... + c_k v_k) = 0. By the definition of eigenvectors, we have c_1 A v_1 + c_2 A v_2 +... + c_k A v_k = 0. Since the eigenvalues are distinct, the matrix A - \lambda_1 I is invertible for \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2. Therefore, we have c_1 A v_1 + c_2 A v_2 +... + c_k A v_k = (A - \lambda_1 I) (c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 +... + c_k v_k) = 0. Since A v_i = \lambda_i v_i, we have c_1 \lambda_1 v_1 + c_2 \lambda_2 v_2 +... + c_k \lambda_k v_k = 0. Therefore, we have (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2) c_1 v_1 + (\lambda_2 - \lambda_3) c_2 v_2 +... + (\lambda_k - \lambda_1) c_k v_k = 0. Since the eigenvalues are distinct, we have \lambda_i \neq \lambda_j for i \neq j. Therefore, we have c_i = 0 for all i. This implies that the eigenvectors are linearly independent."

"Let $A$ and $B$ be two $n\times n$ matrices. Show that $\operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \min(\operatorname{rank}(A), \operatorname{rank}(B))$.","\operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \min(\operatorname{rank}(A), \operatorname{rank}(B)) can be shown by considering the column space of the product matrix AB, which is spanned by the column space of A and the column space of B. Specifically, \operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \dim(\operatorname{col}(A) \cap \operatorname{col}(B)) \leq \min(\dim(\operatorname{col}(A)), \dim(\operatorname{col}(B))). Since \dim(\operatorname{col}(A)) = \operatorname{rank}(A) and \dim(\operatorname{col}(B)) = \operatorname{rank}(B), we conclude that \operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \min(\operatorname{rank}(A), \operatorname{rank}(B))."

How to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem?,"The Cayley-Hamilton theorem can be proven using induction. First, let's consider the case where A is a 1x1 matrix. In this case, A can be written as (a) for some scalar a. Then, the characteristic polynomial of A is given by p(t) = a-t. We have p(A) = aI - A = aA - A = (a-1)A. Therefore, p(A) = 0, which proves the theorem for the 1x1 case. Now, let's consider the case where A is a 2x2 matrix. We can write A as \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} for some scalars a, b, c, and d. Then, the characteristic polynomial of A is given by p(t) = (a-t)(d-t) - bc = ad - t^2 - bc = -t^2 + (a+d)t - (ad + bc). We have p(A) = \begin{bmatrix} -t^2 + (a+d)t - (ad + bc) & -bt \\ -ct & -t^2 + (a+d)t - (ad + bc) \end{bmatrix}. Evaluating this at t = a, we get p(A) = \begin{bmatrix} -a^2 + (a+d)a - (ad + bc) & -ba \\ -ca & -a^2 + (a+d)a - (ad + bc) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -ba \\ -ca & 0 \end{bmatrix} = -A^2. Therefore, p(A) = 0, which proves the theorem for the 2x2 case. Now, let's consider the case where A is a larger matrix. Let A be an nxn matrix, and let A_i denote the ith column of A. We can write A as \begin{bmatrix} A_1 & A_2 & \dots & A_n \end{bmatrix}. Then, the characteristic polynomial of A is given by p(t) = det(tI - A). We have p(A) = det(AI - A) = det(0) = 0. Therefore, p(A) = 0, which proves the theorem for the case where A is an nxn matrix. "
